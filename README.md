# Multi-step Form 

Done with technologies: 
JavaScript(React), Sass, Vite.

In this project I tried many of popular React features, such as: providing Context, Conditional Rendering, Refs, UseEffect, State management.

Some animation also included in dedicated component, which "popups" if user makes changes on previous steps of the form.
